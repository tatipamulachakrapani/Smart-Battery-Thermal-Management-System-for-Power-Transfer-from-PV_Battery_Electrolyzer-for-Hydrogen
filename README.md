# Smart-Power-Controller-PV-Battery-Charging-for-Hydrogen-Generation-System-with-Fast-Power-Adjustment(Ongoing Project)
Design and Development of a Smart Power Controller for Photovoltaic Battery Charging in hydrogen generation system with the capability to adjust fast fluctuations in photovoltaic power

In response to the growing demand for reliable and intelligent energy management systems, this study presents the development of a smart power controller designed for efficient and safe photovoltaic (PV) battery charging, integrated with a real-time fault detection and alert mechanism. The system utilizes a microcontroller-based architecture, combining precision sensing components including the INA219 current and voltage sensor and DS18B20 temperature sensors with a closed-loop control strategy to adaptively regulate the charging process. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm modulates a PWM signal to a power FET, ensuring optimized energy transfer by dynamically adjusting the charging current based on real-time solar input and battery state-of-charge. To enhance operational safety, the controller incorporates hysteresis-based protection circuits that autonomously disconnect the battery under over-temperature and over-voltage conditions, thereby prolonging battery lifespan and preventing hardware damage. Real-time feedback is provided via an OLED display, which continuously reports critical parameters such as solar voltage, battery voltage and current, charge percentage, and internal temperatures. Beyond power management, the system includes a fault detection module equipped with a gas/smoke sensor for proactive identification of thermal or combustion-related anomalies. Upon detecting elevated smoke levels indicative of potential overheating or electrical failure, the system triggers an alert on a 16x2 LCD and initiates SMS-based remote notification through a GSM module, enabling rapid human intervention. The integration of intelligent charging, multi-parameter monitoring, and autonomous fault detection within a single low-cost solution highlights this system's potential for deployment in off-grid solar setups, remote energy stations, and renewable energy applications where efficiency, safety, and resilience are critical.
