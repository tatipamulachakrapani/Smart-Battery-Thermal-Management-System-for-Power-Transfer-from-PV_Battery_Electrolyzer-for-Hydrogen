# Design and Development of Smart Battery Thermal Management System for Power Transfer from PV-Battery-Hydrogen Generation System(Ongoing Project).
Objective: To Design and develop a ultra-thin high porous carbon-coated nickel foam electrode for both AEM electrolyzer \& battery electrodes and Smart Battery Thermal Management System using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)-based Lithium-Ion battery charger (100v, 200w) with current sensing (INA219), addressing thermal runaway prevention, data logging on SD card , and PID control algorithm implemented on Arduino microcontroller.

Working: Using a low-cost carbon(ultra-thin high porous)-coated nickel foam electrode to enhance conductivity, surface stability and active material retention for both AEM electrolyzer \& battery electrodes and evaluating and Simulating electrode performance with ANSYS model \& correlated with experimental CV/EIS results for data validation of its electrochemical performance. By Implementing a control strategy to optimize  thermal performance of Battery(12v, 6600mAh)  and handle fast fluctuations from photovoltaic power Source(upto 100v, 200w) while ensuring system stability.

Features: Integrated hybrid power regulation with pack-level protection using PID algorithm for PV-battery charging \& AEM electrolyzer initial heating (startup phase), with real-time V-I-T monitoring for SoC \& SoH estimation, hysteresis-based cutoff protection, GSM SMS alerts, fire/smoke sensing, and automatic fault-triggered isolation with lockout until stable conditions are restored for off-grid/on-grid and remote renewable applications.
