# Design and Development of Smart Battery Thermal Management System for Power Transfer from PV-Battery-Hydrogen Generation System(Ongoing Project).
Objective: To Design and develop a Smart Battery Thermal Management System using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)-based Lithium-Ion battery charger (100v, 200w) with current sensing (INA219), addressing thermal runaway prevention, data logging on SD card , and PID control algorithm implemented on Arduino microcontroller.

Working: The system utilizes photovoltaic (PV) solar panels as the primary renewable energy source to charge the battery and drive the AEM electrolyzer for green hydrogen generation. By Implementing a control strategy to optimize  thermal performance of Battery Pack(12v, 6600mAh)  and handles fast fluctuations from Solar panel power Source(upto 100v, 200w) while ensuring system stability.

Features: Integrated hybrid power regulation with pack-level protection using PID algorithm for PV-battery charging \& AEM electrolyzer initial heating (startup phase), with real-time V-I-T monitoring for SoC \& SoH estimation, hysteresis-based cutoff protection, GSM SMS alerts, fire/smoke sensing, and automatic fault-triggered isolation with lockout until stable conditions are restored for off-grid/on-grid and remote renewable applications.
